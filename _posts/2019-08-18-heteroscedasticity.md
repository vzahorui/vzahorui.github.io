Heteroscedasticity is a situation when variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it. This actually means that the error is a function of independent variable. Below are several examples of linear regression where heteroscedasticity came into play.

Among examples where heteroscedasticity may arise are relationships between:
 * age and the average weight of a person
 * years of work experieance and salary 
 * company size and its net revenue
