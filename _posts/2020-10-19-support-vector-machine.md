Support vector machine (SVM) is mainly used for building classification models in supervised machine learning, however the ideas employed by SVM can be also used in regression analysis. The main idea in SVM is to find a hyperplane which in an $n$-dimensional space ($n$ is the number of features) lets to differentiate classes.
