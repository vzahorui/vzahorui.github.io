This is an overview of the most commonly used non-parametric statistics in [hypothesis testing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-01-21-hypothesis-testing.md %}) explaining when to use each. Unlike the [parametric conterparts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-03-22-hypothesis-test-parametric-statistics.md %}), these tests fo not assume that the data is [normally distributed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-03-27-statistical-distributions.md %}#normal_distribution).

The benefit of not assuming the normal distribution of the data in the non-parametric tests comes at a cost - they might be less powerful than the parametric ones.
