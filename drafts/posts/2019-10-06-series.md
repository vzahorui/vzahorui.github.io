Series can be expressed as a sequance of numbers. 

They can be convergent and divergent as demonstrated below.

Is this example we see that the convergent series approaches 0 when $n$ becomes substantially big: $\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty}} a_n=0$.
Convergent series can be defined as series which approch some particular number when $n$ approaches infinity. When this does not hold true, a series is divergent.
