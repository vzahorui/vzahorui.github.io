Geneally speaking, interpolation is a way of generating new data points which exactly fit into some given set of points. It is used for approximation of complex functions with simple ones, for example when estimating missing values between known data points. 

## Polynomial interpolation

Perhaps the most well-known interploation method which is used for finding a function which exactly fits a line into each of the given data points. For $n$ data points there always exists such function of at least $n-1$ degree. 

Although we can fit a line to any number of points, the error of a function will be increasing with the number of degree of polynomial. Polynomial functions oscillate and the magnitude of oscillation increases for higher degree polynomials, which results into unnatural forms of a function at places other than the points to which the function was originally fitted.
